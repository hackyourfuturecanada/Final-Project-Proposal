Project Name : G1 Test Multi Language

Project Description: You can now take the 'G1 Driving Test' exam in several languages. Just tell the attendant you will take the Turkish, Arabic etc. exam before you take the exam. Example, You will see all the questions in both Turkish and English. You will be able to work with the G1 Test English system before taking the official exam.  The questions here are very similar to the actual exam questions. With the questions you will learn here with your language, it will be much easier to pass the real exam. Here you will be able to prepare for the exam in 4 main categories. Signs, Rules, Practice and Real Test. First time I will go on production with Turkish and English. I will add other languages later.
